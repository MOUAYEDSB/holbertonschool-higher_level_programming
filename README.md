# Authorâ€™s disclaimer

Welcome to the Python world!

You'll soon find that with Python (and the majority of higher level languages), there are ten different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while other tasks will have multiple possible implementations.
Python has a linter / style guide, called PEP8, also now known as PyCode. At Holberton, we won't start off with using PyCode, because it's much more strict compared to PEP8. Don't worry if you see a warning when you are running PEP8, you can ignore it.

Enjoy!

# Holberton School - Higher Level Programming

Welcome to the Higher Level Programming repository of Holberton School! This repository contains projects and assignments focused on various programming languages and concepts, aimed at developing your skills in higher-level programming.

# About

At Holberton School, we believe in a comprehensive and practical approach to learning programming. In this repository, you will find projects that cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Python
- JavaScript
- Algorithms
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures
- SQL
- API integration
- Web scraping
  Each project is designed to challenge you and help you deepen your understanding of the programming language and concept being covered. By working on these projects, you will gain hands-on experience and develop problem-solving skills that are essential for success in the field of software engineering.

# Requirements

To work with the projects in this repository, you will need the following:

- An up-to-date web browser
- A code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice
- Specific requirements and instructions can be found in each project's README file

# Projects

The repository is organized into project directories, each focusing on a different programming language or concept. Below is a list of some of the notable projects you will find in this repository:

1. 0x00-python-hello_world: This project serves as an introduction to Python programming. It covers the basics of the language and includes exercises on variables, data types, operators, and more.

2. 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions: In this project, you will dive deeper into Python and explore concepts such as conditional statements, loops, and functions. It provides exercises to reinforce your understanding of control flow and logical operations.

3. 0x03-python-data_structures: Here, you will learn about various data structures in Python, such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries. You will also work on exercises to practice manipulating and accessing data within these structures.

4. 0x0C-python-almost_a_circle: This project is an exciting milestone that combines multiple concepts, including inheritance, file I/O, serialization, and more. It challenges you to build a robust Python application that represents and manipulates geometric shapes.

Please note that this is just a small selection of projects. There are many more interesting and challenging projects waiting for you to explore in this repository!
